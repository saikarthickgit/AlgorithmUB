**Topological Sort using DFS**

TOPOLOGICAL-SORT-DFS(Graph G):
    Input: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) G = (V, E)
    Output: A topological ordering of vertices

    1. Mark all vertices as UNVISITED
    2. Initialize an empty stack S

    3. For each vertex u in V:
           If u is UNVISITED:
                DFS(u)

    4. Return the stack S (popped order gives topological sort)

DFS(u):
    1. Mark u as VISITED
    2. For each neighbor v of u:
           If v is UNVISITED:
                DFS(v)
    3. PUSH u onto stack S
```
