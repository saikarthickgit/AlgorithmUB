1. Interval Scheduling
Problem:
	•	We have n jobs (intervals), each with a start time and finish time.
	•	Goal: Select the maximum number of non-overlapping jobs.

Greedy Strategy (Earliest Finish Time First):
	•	Always pick the interval that finishes earliest among the remaining ones.

 Sort intervals by their finishing times
 A ← ∅                  // selected intervals
 for j = 1 to n do
     if job j is compatible with A then
         A ← A ∪ {j}
 return A1: Sort intervals by their finishing times
