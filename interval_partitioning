Problem:Problem:
	•	We have n jobs (intervals), each with a start and finish time.
	•	Goal: Assign jobs to the minimum number of resources (machines, classrooms, etc.) so that no two overlapping jobs share the same resource.

Greedy Strategy (Earliest Start Time First):
	•	Process jobs in order of increasing start time.
	•	Assign each job to the first available resource.

Sort intervals by their starting times
 For each job j in order:
    if there exists a resource that is free for job j then
        assign job j to that resource
     else
        allocate a new resource and assign job j to it: Sort intervals by their starting times
